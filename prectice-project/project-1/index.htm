                <h2>First female teacher of India</h2>
                <p><b>Savitribai Phule </b> ( 3 January 1831- 10 March 1897) was a teacher, Indian social reformer, educationalist, and poet from
                    Maharashtra.
                    Along with her husband, Jyotiba Phule in Maharashtra, she played a vital role in improving women's
                    rights in India. She is considered to be the pioneer of India's feminist movement. Savitribai and
                    Jyotiba together founded one of the early modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhidewada in 1848.
                    She strived to abolish discrimination and unfair treatment of people on the basis of caste and
                    gender.

                    Savitribai Phule was the first woman who started the first ever school in India exclusively for
                    girls at a time when nobody could dare to even think about educating a girl. In fact, every educated
                    woman in the society owes a debt to her. There are so many big names of Indian women like Indira
                    Gandhi (Former Prime Minister Of India), Pratibha Patil (Former President Of India), Sarojini Naidu
                    and many others who have made their names in the history because of their education and wisdom.
                    However, not much is available in the history about Savitribai Phule, a woman who kept the
                    foundation for women education in India.</p>
